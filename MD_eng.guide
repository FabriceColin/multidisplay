MultiDisplay has been created to fulfill the author needs. So perhaps that noone will
 find it interesting. Nevertheless if you begin using it, you won't be able to live
  without it.
This version should run on any Amiga with system 3.x.

MD has been created and intensively tested on the following configuration :
 Commodore A1200 Tower

@Node Introduction "MultiDisplay : But why ? Mais pourquoi ? Aber warum ?"

MultiDisplay is intelligent enough (really ?) to find what the datatype of a file is
 thanks to the datatypes library and to call the appropriate viewer/player/editor.
The type recognition can also be extended to file names.
Datatypes are particularly slow with some file formats. Specially designed utilities
 are sometimes better. This is the reason behind MultiDisplay.

Of course you can find dozens of similar tools on the Aminet.
MD delivers its full power 8-) when used with a ToolManager-like program (ToolManager is
 Copyright © 1990-1997 Stefan Becker). MD also supports the AppIcon feature.

C sources are included so that you (or your little sister) can customize it.

@Node Usage "MultiDisplay : User Manual"

MultiDisplay knows several options :
@{B}All/S@{UB} : when using DOS wildcards directories that match the pattern will be entered
 and all file examined.
 Default : false. Can be activated by tooltype (ALL).
@{B}Sync/S@{UB} : force synchronous commands.
 Default: false. Can be activated by tooltype (SYNC).
@{B}ShowDT/S@{UB} : an information requester pops up and shows file name and its datatype.
 Synchronous commands will be used (Sync is set to true).
 Default: false. Can be activated by tooltype.
@{B}Files/M@{UB} : files to be opened.

There is another option that can only be tooltype-activated.
@{B}AppIcon@{UB} : MD opens an AppIcon on your Workbench (MD current icon) so that you can drop
 file icons on it. A double click on the AppIcon makes MD close.
 Unlike previous versions this tooltype is ignored when arguments are passed and it makes a bit
 more sense. In other words, just double-click on MD and it will open its AppIcon.
 Default: false.

Tooltypes will only be used in Workbench mode.

Have a look at @{" Configuration " LINK Configuration} for more information...

@Node Configuration "MultiDisplay : Efficient configuration"

MultiDisplay works with a configuration file called MD.config. This file may sit in the same
 directory as MultiDisplay or in S:.
For each datatype the corresponding viewer must be defined. Typically two lines are necessary :
      <type name>
      <path where MD can find your viewer>
For instance :
      gif
      C:ZGif
The type name corresponds to the name of the Datatype as it appears in DEVS:Datatypes.

It is possible to give a pattern to search for in file names. For instance :
      #.jpeg
      BIN:Viewers/FastJPEG
The # caracter makes the difference between datatypes and patterns (we could have written jpeg) but
 it is not considered as a wildcard.

Furthermore if a file cannot be identified with the types you specified, MultiDisplay will use a
 default viewer that MUST be given at the very beginning of MD.config.
The first types have precedence on those that follow.
If MultiDisplay is called without any argument or in Workbench mode without the APPICON tooltype
 a file requester will pop up (multi selection possible).

The following is a sample configuration file.

---------------------------------------------->8-------------------------------------------

In the supplied example, every ascii file will be viewed with MuchMore. But for each file whose name
 contains "install", even if it is an ascii file (it should be), MD will call Installer.

If the syntax of MD.config was not respected, MultiDisplay would probably do some strange things!
 For instance, if MD.config begins with the following :
      <default viewer>
      ilbm
      <ilbm viewer>
      gif
      jpeg
      <jpeg viewer>  etc ...
"MD pic:gif/stuff.gif" will  cause this command : "jpeg pic:gif/stuff.gif" and probably an error
 message saying that "jpeg" is an unknown command.

Note that, as you have probably noticed, comments are now allowed anywhere in the configuration file
as long as the first line remains the default instruction. They have to be less than 512 caracters
long unless what some nasty and unpredictable things will happen (eg "I will summon Satan all over
your hard drive", see what I mean ?).

      In Workbench mode, MD does no longer open a silly file requester after the last argument
      Fixed a bug concerning relative paths with the file requester (stupid me)
      APPICON is now ignored when MD is launched with WB arguments
      The FILES option is not compulsory any more (/A/M to /M)
      The information given by SHOWDT is now a bit more complete (file name plus datatype group and base name)
      Comments in the configuration file are allowed after the default instruction
      Last but not least, the executable has been renamed to "MultiDisplay" !

Future : Commodity ? No more mistakes in the English documentation ?

@Node Bugs "MultiDisplay : Eventual problems ... Bugs ?"

In some cases, asking MD to open files that do not have the same type can cause some minor
 problems because of asynchronous commands (default behaviour).

Let's say that you type "MD pic:GIF/Aigle.GIF Data:Divers/AliensAhead/AliensAhead.guide" in
 a shell window and that you are using the sample MD.config we have just seen.
 Fastview will be called for "aigle.gif". About the third of the picture will appear before that
 PowerGuide is called for "aliensahead.guide". The problem is that its window will open on the
 current pubscreen, that is the screen on which "aigle.gif" is displayed! Adding
 PUBSCREEN=Workbench after "...PowerGuide" in MD.config should solve it.

Of course, not every viewer supports this option so you should prefer those who open their own
 screen. Note that this problem can be avoided if you specify the Sync option.

If you use a wildcard, e.g. "MD PIC:G#?", the files contained in the directories that match this
 pattern, such as the pictures of your PIC:GIF drawer, won't be examined by MD unless All is specified
 (option or tooltype).

MultiDisplay is simple but efficient in its own way. If you currently use ToolManager, define
 MD as a tool in a dock. Or you may also iconify it onto your Workbench.

For any bug report feel free to contact me. I have realized that version 1.8 was quite annoying
 sometimes. It was due to my laziness to test everything and to the fact that I used to run MD in
 my own way without bothering about how people could run it ! Hopefully I have corrected this
 situation. Well... at least I hope so :-) Have a look at the @{"versions review" LINK History}.

@Node Author "MultiDisplay : Who I am and where to contact me"

I can be reached by the following Internet links. Do not hesitate to read my modest web pages
 or to leave a message. If I have enough time to change my homepage (almost completely in French
 at the moment !) I will probably add the latest MultiDisplay version and perhaps some of my other
 superb creations.
If you have localized MD in another language, feel free to send me your catalog...

Thanks to
 - the authors of the utilities appearing in the sample configuration.
 - the Amiga community around the world.
