# multidisplay
[m68k-amigaos] Calls user-defined viewers according to file types.

MultiDisplay allows you to use the appropriate viewer for each file according to
its datatype.
You can also use name patterns matching (for instance "mod", ".script", ...).
MultiDisplay can be started from CLI or Workbench. A ReqTools interface is
opened if necessary.
The result is a fast all-purposes viewer...
It delivers its full power 8-) if used with a ToolManager-like program or when
launched as an AppIcon.
Beware, MultiDisplay is really addictive...

All bugs/annoyances relative to the first Aminet release have been corrected
(hmm... I think so).
